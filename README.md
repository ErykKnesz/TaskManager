# TaskManager

The purpose of this app is to bear some resemblance to the famous task management tools such as Trello etc. A user can create his or her account and tasks, assign optional categories to them, edit them, delete complete or un-complete.

Sorting and filtering of tasks by dates or status is also implemented.
